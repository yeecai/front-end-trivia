throttle will only call the function and once per n secs, debounce will delay ns to call the function, if interrupted during the ns, start again, e.g. a search(<input>)will get a search result only there's no input for ns.

throttle:
    1. is good for search input.
    2. scroll event

debounce:
    1.  good for the click event, like mousedown.
    2. window frequently resize
