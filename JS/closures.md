- [x] What is closues:  a special object, with functions(or a function am not sure) and some variables outside it's scope, and the function can access those out-of-scope variables because of closure, kinda like private function within a class in other OOP languages i.g. JAVA or C++.
- [x] What's for:  closure is one of the strategies that make JS OOP too, hooray!
- [x] Pitfalls: You might bug your program with loops by creating closures and it might cause memory leak.

more: 
1. function currying is implemented with closures
2. snapshot of the stack so the function can access to the variable
