1.
  - [x] HOF(higher order function) take another function(lambda or callback) as argument or return value, all functions are 1st class functions which can be assigned to variables and passed the another function or as return value.
  - [x] callback(execute depends on the caller) and lambda(simple expression that create functions => anoymous function)
2.  
- [x] Impetative(bad, i.g.forloop an array) and declarative(use Map instead to avoid semantic errors)
3. 
- [x] avoid mutation: pass arguments instead change global variables.
Changes lead to bugs, ideally function should be pure, which means no side-effects like mutation.
4. explain side-effects and why side-effects is 'evil'
- [x] unpredictable [ref](https://dzone.com/articles/side-effects-1#:~:text=The%20reason%20why%20side%20effects,result%2C%20given%20the%20same%20input.)
