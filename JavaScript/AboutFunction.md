1. Function declarations

use function keyword to declara a function

- hoisted to top of context
- return undefined if there is no return statement or return nothing
- in strict mode of ES6, it's ok to declare function in block but it's only visible inside the block at the same time.


2. Function Invocation
 - in strict method, function except arrow function has no this property, and in non-strict method it refer to the global object.
