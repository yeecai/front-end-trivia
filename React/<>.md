Wow, do you know that <> can be tiny bit faster than <div>?


### Motivation

Sometimes you need to split some tags in parent node, which would need to introduce extra node,
cus JSX require you wrap the return value into a tag i.g. <div>. Fragment solved this problem. 
It can be a bit of faster than <div> cus Fragment does not create a new node(but you still need to use <Fragment> if you need to write key, and key is the only attribute can be passed to Fragement), 
it also won't break some specifc CSS styling between the parent and child component and the syntax sugar <></> is more readable.
