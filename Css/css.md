### Position: absolute vs relative vs fixed


static is the default one aka normal position, according to where it is in the html file.

fixed at left right top bottom of the viewport

relative is relative to static based on change of 'left;right;..'

absolute is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor

as for sticky, you know, like a sticky footer
