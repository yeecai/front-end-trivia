### Position: absolute vs relative vs fixed


1. static is the default one aka normal position, according to where it is in the html file.

2. fixed at left right top bottom of the current window

3. relative is relative to static based on change of 'left;right;..'

4. absolute is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor(if there's no absolute ancester, will reverse to <html>)

5. Sticky: sticky to the bottom of screen, like sticky footer


### px, em, rem, vw, wh

1. em 
2. 

### Block, inline, inline-block
 1. Block: one element one line
 i.g. ```<div>```
 2. inline, can't change size(width, height, padding), same line with other inline elements.
 i.g. ```<span>```
 3. inline-block: still inline but can set width, height, padding etc. i.g. ```<img> <input>```
 
 ### Semantic tag
 1. Good for search engine to take snapshot
 2. Good for render the content ?
